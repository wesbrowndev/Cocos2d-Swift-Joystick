Joystick Control for Cocos2d Objective-C (in Swift)
===================================================

This is a simple Joystick used for SpriteBuilder and Cocos2d ObjC v3.4.9!

Clone to desktop and open file under SpriteBuilder.

-You may need to add the .spritebuilder extension to the folder
-If SpriteBuilder is still buggy, recreate the project and copy and replace MainScene.swift (in the folder /Source) as well as copy and replace /Packages
into the new project.

Check out MainScene.swift to check how things were implemented.

I don’t have any tutorials but I figure the code is simple enough
for anyone needing to add a “joystick” function to their game or app.

===================================================

It has been updated for use with Xcode 8.1 and iOS10.
