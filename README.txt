Joystick Control for Cocos2d Objective-C (in Swift)
===================================================

This is a simple Joystick used for SpriteBuilder and Cocos2d ObjC!

Clone to desktop and open file under SpriteBuilder.
Check out MainScene.swift to check how things were implemented.

I don’t have any “tutorials” but I figure the code is simple enough
for anyone needing to add a “joystick” function to their game or app.

===================================================

It has been updated for use with Xcode 7 and iOS9.
